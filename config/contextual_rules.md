# Contextual Inspection Playbook

Use these inspector notes to flag nuanced issues after the deterministic rules complete.

## Corner Openings in Seismic Zones

- Inspect any window or door that sits within 300 mm of a panel edge.
- If the seismic zone is 3 or higher, require dedicated lateral bracing and continuous load transfer hardware.
- Flag the opening whenever jack studs or hold-downs are missing from the deterministic results.

## Mechanical Penetrations Near Openings

- When ducts or sleeves pass within 150 mm of a window or door, confirm that the surrounding studs have backing plates.
- If the deterministic run already reported a clearance violation, escalate severity to "high" and recommend a field engineer review.

## Overloaded Stud Bays

- A stud bay is considered overloaded if it contains both an opening header and a mechanical penetration.
- Note any studs adjacent to such bays and recommend adding sister studs even if spacing technically passes.
